PREPARATION

1) Before you begin making the dough, grease oil on an idli pan or a steamer pan and keep ready. 
2) If you have banana leaves then cut them in squares and place them on the idli moulds. Grease the banana leaves with some oil.
3) Roasting Rice Flour For Idiyappam Recipe
4) Heat a kadai or pan. Keep the flame to a low and add 1 cup rice flour (130 grams).
5) On a low flame stirring often roast the rice flour for 4 to 5 minutes. You don't need to brown the flour. Its just lightly roasted and this helps in making soft idiyappams.
6) Continue to stir and roast till you see steam coming from the rice flour.
7) When you see steam appearing from the rice flour, then switch off the flame. Remove the rice flour in a mixing bowl or pan.
8) Kneading Dough For Idiyappam
9) In the same kadai or pan in which rice flour was roasted, add 1.25 to 1.3 cups water.
10) Add Â¼ teaspoon salt.
11) Let the water come to a boil. The water has to be hot but should not be very hot. Do not allow it to come to a rolling boil. When you see tiny bubbles appearing in the water and it begins to start boiling, thats the time you switch off the flame.
12) Then add the hot water in the rice flour.
13) Begin to mix with a spoon or spatula. mix very well.
14) Keep on mixing and when the heat is tolerable then you can begin to knead. If you cannot knead then wait for 1 to 2 minutes and when the heat can be tolerated then start kneading. Do note that the dough has to be hot when you knead.
15) Knead to a smooth and soft dough. If the dough looks dry then you can sprinkle some warm water on it and continue to knead. If the dough become sticky then add a few tablespoons rice flour and knead.


MAKING IDDIYAPAM

1) Take the disc meant for making the idiyappam and spread some water or oil on it.
2) Also before you start making idiyappam, heat 2 cups water in a pan or pressure cooker and let it come to a boil. Keep water on low to medium flame.
3) Divide the dough into 2 to 3 portions. Prepare a log from one portion and place it in the idiyappam/murukku maker. Grease the idiyappam maker with some oil or water before you place the dough in it. Cover the rest of the dough with a kitchen napkin so that they don't dry out.

4) Now begin to press the idiyappam/murukku maker directly on the idli moulds in a concentric round circle.
5) Form one roundel of the idiyappam.
6) While making idiyappams, the dough has to be hot or warm.
7) This way continue to make idiyappams on all the idli moulds.
8) Sprinkle some grated coconut on top of each idiappam. Coconut is optional and can be skipped. Alternatively you can sprinkle fresh grated coconut and sugar just before serving.
9) Now place the idli stand in the pan.
10) Cover pan with a lid. If using pressure cooker, then remove the whistle (vent weight) and cover the cooker.
11) On medium to high flame steam idiyappams for 9 to 10 minutes. After they are cooked well, switch off the flame and let the idiyappams be inside the steamer pan for 1 to 2 minutes.
12) Then remove the idli stand from the pan. Remove the idiyappams with a spatula and serve the idiyappam. 
13) If you have used banana leaves then you just need to pick up the banana leaves and serve. If not serving immediately then place the idiappam in a casserole so that they stay warm.


Serve idiyappam or nool puttu with veg korma, potato korma, mushroom korma, veg stew or potato stew or jaggery sweetened coconut milk.
